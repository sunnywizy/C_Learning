All about printf function in C Language.

The printf function in C is used for formatted output, which means it's used to print text and values to the console or terminal in a specific format. It stands for "print formatted" and is part of the standard input/output library (stdio.h) in C.

format_string: This is a string that specifies the format of the output. It can include plain text and format specifiers. Format specifiers start with % followed by a character that indicates the type of value to be printed.

arguments: These are the values that will be inserted into the format string in place of the corresponding format specifiers. The number and type of arguments must match the format specifiers in the format string.

The printf function is used to display the values of the variables initial, age, and height in a specific format. The format specifiers %c, %d, and %.2f are used to indicate the types of values being inserted. The .2 in %.2f specifies that the floating-point number should be printed with two decimal places.

The printf function is a powerful tool for displaying text and data in a controlled and organized manner, making it an essential function for communicating with the user in C programs.
