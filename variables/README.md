This directory  has deal with everything concerning variables in C programming.

In a C program, a variable is a named storage location in the computer's memory that is used to store a value. This value can be a number, a character, a string, or any other data type supported by the C programming language. Variables provide a way to store and manipulate data during the execution of a program.

Variables have the following characteristics:

Name: Each variable has a unique identifier called its name. The name is used to reference and access the stored value.

Data Type: Variables have a specific data type that defines the kind of data they can hold. Common data types include integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and pointers.

Value: A variable holds a value of its designated data type. This value can be assigned when the variable is created or at a later point in the program's execution.

Memory Location: Each variable is associated with a memory location in the computer's RAM where its value is stored.

In C, variables need to be declared before they can be used. The declaration specifies the variable's name and data type.
